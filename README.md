# Robot-Control
This program controls a sorting robot
This program keeps track of which way the robot is facing
The robot grasps a bottle or fragment, lifts it, then rotates to the appropriate conveyor(or the waste container) and lowers the bottle and releases it. After releasing the bottle(or fragment) the robot rotates back (oposite direction) to the incoming conveyor belt
